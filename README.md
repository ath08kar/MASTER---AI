🚀 MASTER
Multi-Agent Explainable Stock Intelligence System
MASTER is a production-inspired, AI-driven stock market decision support platform built to bridge the gap between black-box ML predictions and human-understandable investment decisions.
The system leverages a multi-agent architecture, supervised machine learning, and a deterministic orchestration layer to generate transparent BUY / SELL / HOLD recommendations, complete with explainable reasoning and automated research reports.

🎯 Designed with real-world fintech, analytics, and AI system design principles in mind.

🧩 Problem Statement
Retail investors and analysts often face:
Fragmented signals from technical indicators
Black-box ML models with no clear reasoning
Manual, time-consuming market research
Lack of explainability behind trading decisions

MASTER solves this by combining AI, rule-based logic, and explainability into a single intelligent workflow.

💡 Solution Overview
MASTER acts as an automated research analyst, where specialized AI agents collaborate to:
Understand market conditions
Predict short-term price movement
Resolve conflicting signals logically
Explain why a decision was made — and why not
All outputs are presented via an interactive dashboard and professional PDF reports.

✨ Key Features

📈 Real-time stock data ingestion using Yahoo Finance
🤖 Trained ML model for next-day price movement prediction
🧠 Multi-agent architecture with clear role separation
⚖️ Deterministic orchestrator for decision fusion
📊 Interactive Streamlit dashboard
📝 Auto-generated, explainable PDF research reports
❓ “Why-not” explainability for rejected trade actions
📐 Technical indicators: RSI, EMA Cross, ATR, Volatility
🔒 Session-safe UI (no state reset on user interaction)

🤖 Multi-Agent Design
1️⃣ Market Researcher Agent
Role: Market context & regime detection
Identifies Bullish / Bearish / Neutral regimes
Computes volatility-based confidence
Generates human-readable market explanations

2️⃣ Technical ML Agent

Role: Probabilistic price movement prediction
Supervised classifier trained on historical OHLCV data
Feature set includes:
RSI (14)
EMA (12 & 26) + crossover signal
ATR (14)
Volatility (20-day rolling std)
Outputs probabilities for UP / HOLD / DOWN

3️⃣ Orchestrator Agent (Decision Engine)
Role: Final decision authority
Fuses outputs from all agents
Applies confidence thresholds
Resolves conflicting signals
Produces final BUY / SELL / HOLD recommendation
This hybrid AI + rule-based approach improves reliability over pure ML systems.

4️⃣ Report Writer Agent
Role: Explainability & communication
Converts decisions into structured narratives
Generates professional-grade PDF research reports
Includes:
Market regime context
ML probability outputs
Decision reasoning & “why-not” explanations

📊 Dashboard Experience
Built using Streamlit, the dashboard enables:
NSE stock selection
Configurable historical lookback window
Market regime visualization
ML probability bars
Price & indicator charts
Final decision panel
Detailed explainability section
One-click PDF report download

🤖 Machine Learning Model
Model Type: Supervised classification
Training Data: Historical stock market data
Prediction Horizon: Next trading day
Target Classes
UP
HOLD
DOWN
